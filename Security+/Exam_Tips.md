1. There are no trick questions
- read each question multiple times
- generally speaking, at least one of the answers written for each test is meant to pull attention away from the correct answer

2. Note all **bold** *italics* and All UPPERCASE words

3. Only answer questions based on the CompTIA book
  - when in doubt choose the answer that is correct for the highest number of situations
      - do not try to talk yourself into a lower answer
